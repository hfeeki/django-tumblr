I'm trying to learn Django (and also get serious about programming), so I'm building a version of a tumblog.

Right now, the following is implemented:
	-a really, really basic blog post structure
	-created a container element, called "tumblog" to hold different types of posts
	-created app for tweets
	-created app for quotes
	
To-do:
	-create apps for links, images and video
	-figure out how to do all that stuff
	-import the default wordpress theme, and make it work with that

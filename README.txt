I'm trying to learn Django (and also get serious about programming), so I'm building a version of a tumblog.

Right now, the following is implemented:
	-a really, really basic blog post structure
	-created a container element, called "tumblog" to hold different types of posts
	-created app for tweets
	-created app for quotes
	-created app for links
	-imported default wordpress theme, and updated to reflect post types
	-created syncing script for tweets
	
To-do:
	-create apps for images and video
	-create pages for archive of a specific day, and a month archive of only posts
	-decide on database solution
	-decide on deployment method
	-implement some kind of cron jobs or task management shit
	-de-crazyify the wordpress template classes and divs

I'm trying to learn Django (and also get serious about programming), so I'm building a version of a tumblog.

Right now, the following is implemented:
	-a really, really basic blog post structure
	(not much else)
	
To-do:
	-create a container element, called "blog" to hold all the different types of posts
	-create apps for tweets, quotes, links, images and video
	-figure out how to do all that stuff
	-import the default wordpress theme, and make it work with that
